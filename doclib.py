    '''# HotSLogs Builds cheatsheet
Here are the most popular Hero of the Storm Heros' builds in a shorthand format.''',

    '''## Shorthand for build
My shorthand format is each talent tier gets represent by a number, that number is the number of choices down from the first talent for that tier.  I group the teir talent numbers symetrically with the first 3 levels and last 3 bunched up, and lvl 10 with dashes around it.  See the example at the bottom if this is confusing or click through to the hero pages.''',
    '''## How?
Feel free to browse the sourcecode in the github project, I asked for permission before scraping HotSLogs and do so only once a day (and republish the latest info here)''',
    '''## Why?
I like my cheatsheets / short hand builds / I don't memorize by talent names as easily.  I assume there are plenty of new players that could benefit from this knowledge too.''',

    '''## Example
E.G. ToughGuy: 321-2-524 means ToughGuy's build goes like this

level  1 = 3rd talent choice from top
level  4 = 2nd talent
level  7 = 1st talent
level 10 = 2nd talent
level 13 = 5th talent
level 16 = 2nd talent
level 20 = 4th talent
